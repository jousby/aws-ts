# AWS + Typescript 

Starter project for Typescript + AWS SDK

A Jan 2020 attempt at creating a best of breed 'industrialised' typescript project for interacting with AWS api's. 

Features:

- Includes the amazing fp-ts library and attempts to apply a functional programming style to using AWS API's. 
- Typescript-logging for doing log4'x' style logging. 
- ESlint (now that TSLint is merging)
- Prettier for automated code formatting
- Testy.ts for a TS friendly testing library
- NYC for code coverage
- Watch for applying continuous builds on save
- Editorconfig and gitattributes files for helping prevent spurious code diffs.
